# Mars Data Scraping and Analysis

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

### Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `part_1_mars_news.ipynb` in the starter code folder.
2. Utilize automated browsing to visit the Mars News website.
3. Inspect the page to identify the elements to scrape.
   - **Hint:** Create a Beautiful Soup object to extract text elements from the website.
4. Extract titles and preview text of the news articles.
   - Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary with keys 'title' and 'preview'.
     - Example:
     ```python
     {'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm", 
      'preview': "For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASAâ€™s MAVEN mission witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27."}
     ```
   - Store all dictionaries in a Python list.
5. Print the list in your notebook.
6. Optionally, store the scraped data in a file (e.g., JSON).

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

### Instructions
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb` in the starter code folder.
2. Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site.
3. Inspect the page to identify the elements to scrape (URL: https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html).
   - **Hint:** Create a Beautiful Soup object to scrape data from the HTML table.
4. Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame with columns matching the table on the website.
   - Columns: id, terrestrial_date, sol, ls, month, min_temp, pressure.
5. Analyze the dataset using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:
   - How many months exist on Mars?
   - How many Martian (not Earth) days of data are in the dataset?
   - What are the coldest and warmest months on Mars?
     - Find average minimum daily temperature for all months and plot the results as a bar chart.
   - Which months have the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars?
     - Find average daily atmospheric pressure for all months and plot the results as a bar chart.
   - Estimate the number of terrestrial days in a Martian year.
     - Consider Earth days elapsed in the time Mars circles the Sun.
     - Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
6. Export the DataFrame to a CSV file.
